## Version
1.0.0  
## Installation

With Cocoapods simple add this to your podfile
```sh
pod PBTimelineView
```
or  Copy paste the lib folder on your project
## How to use
```swift
 mTimelineView.data = [
            ["Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance"],
            ["Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance"],
            ["Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance"],
            ["Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance","Boxe","Dance"]				   
        ];
 mTimelineView.delegate = self
```
Note: For now you can only add texts programmatically.
## Delegate
If you have set a PBTimelineViewDelegate to the PBTimelineView you can handle the callback like this:
```swift
 func onClickItem(titleItem: String, id: Int, section: Int) {
       // Do stuff with item
       print("\(titleItem) on section \(section) and item nÂ°\(id)");
 }
```
